% #### Intro
% - Mention the **goals** of the project, making reference to them with where the current state of the project, analysis, and results are [0]
% - **N-body problem** [5/4]
% 	- Different methods/integrators
% - **Core "system" dissolution [4/5]**
% - **Binary formation [3]** - *Matthew Bate (Exeter)*
% 	- Capture ->
% 		- 3-body encounters
% 		- Dissipatin gas encounters
% 	- Fragmentation
% - **Binary properties [1]**
% 	- Why are binary stars important?
% 	- What do we know and what are we yet to find out about them?
% - **Star formation [2] **
% 	- Molecular cloud collapse
% 	- Jeans Mass
% 	- Prestellar cores
% 	- Class 0/I/II/III
% 		- Assuming we are at class II/III,
% 		- Mention class III also has a disk around it, which we will not be using.
% 	- Where star formation takes place in molecular clouds
% 		- Supersonic turbulence,
% 		- Structure/filaments.

% The **N-body problem** and **core "system" dissolution** are linked together, talk about:
% - What has been done and previously studied?
% - *What are we going to do?*
% 	- Type of n-body
% 	- What is being studied? (setup)
% 	- What we will report and why
