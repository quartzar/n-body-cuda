  abstract = {The paper presents results of a search for spectroscopic binaries among 135 bright field stars of types F3 - G2 IV or V. Orbital elements for 25 newly discovered spectroscopic binaries are derived from radial velocities measured in 20 coude spectra for each star, and velocity curves are also computed for each of these binaries. It is found that the ratios of observed singles:doubles:triples:quadruples among the 135 program stars are 42:46:9:2. The 88 computed and estimated periods show a relatively smooth distribution with a single maximum and a median period of 14 years. It is tentatively suggested that the discovered binaries show no pronounced grouping tendency in age or evolutionary state. The number of binaries not revealed is estimated, the secondary masses for both the observed and undetected binaries are determined statistically, and it is concluded that the short-period binaries are fission systems while the long-period systems are those in which pairs of protostars contracted separately. On the average, the multiple systems are found to be 0.22 magnitude brighter than the primaries alone.},

  abstract = {The earliest phases of clustered star formation and the origin of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) are currently much debated. In order to constrain the origin of the IMF, we investigated the internal and relative motions of starless condensations and protostars previously detected by us in the dust continuum at 1.2mm in the L1688 protocluster of the Ophiuchus molecular cloud complex. The starless condensations have a mass spectrum resembling the IMF and are therefore likely representative of the initial stages of star formation in the protocluster. We carried out detailed molecular line observations, including some N2H+(1-0) mapping, of the Ophiuchus protocluster condensations using the IRAM 30m telescope. We measured subsonic or at most transonic levels of internal turbulence within the condensations, implying virial masses which generally agree within a factor of \textasciitilde{} 2 with the masses derived from the 1.2mm dust continuum. This supports the notion that most of the L1688 starless condensations are gravitationally bound and prestellar in nature. We measured a global one-dimensional velocity dispersion of less than 0.4 km/s between condensations. This small relative velocity dispersion implies that, in general, the condensations do not have time to interact with one another before evolving into pre-main sequence objects. Our observations support the view that the IMF is partly determined by cloud fragmentation at the prestellar stage. Competitive accretion is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism at the protostellar stage in the Ophiuchus protocluster, but it may possibly govern the growth of starless, self-gravitating condensations initially produced by gravoturbulent fragmentation toward an IMF, Salpeter-like mass spectrum.},

  abstract = {Until recently the gravitational N-body problem has been modelled numerically either by direct integration, in which the computation needed increases as N2, or by an iterative potential method in which the number of operations grows as N log N. Here we describe a novel method of directly calculating the force on N bodies that grows only as N log N. The technique uses a tree-structured hierarchical subdivision of space into cubic cells, each of which is recursively divided into eight subcells whenever more than one particle is found to occupy the same cell. This tree is constructed anew at every time step, avoiding ambiguity and tangling. Advantages over potential-solving codes are: accurate local interactions; freedom from geometrical assumptions and restrictions; and applicability to a wide class of systems, including (proto-)planetary, stellar, galactic and cosmological ones. Advantages over previous hierarchical tree-codes include simplicity and the possibility of rigorous analysis of error. Although we concentrate here on stellar dynamical applications, our techniques of efficiently handling a large number of long-range interactions and concentrating computational effort where most needed have potential applications in other areas of astrophysics as well.},

We describe the modifications that we have made to the code. We present several test calculations and comparisons with existing studies to illustrate the validity of the code. We show that our code finds very good agreement with direct N-body simulations including primordial binaries and stellar evolution. We find significant differences in the evolution of the global properties of the simulated clusters using stellar evolution compared with simulations without any stellar evolution. In particular, we find that the mass loss from the stellar evolution acts as a significant energy production channel simply by reducing the total gravitational binding energy and can significantly prolong the initial core contraction phase before reaching the binary-burning quasi-steady state of the cluster evolution. We simulate a large grid of models varying the initial cluster mass, binary fraction, and concentration parameter, and we compare properties of the simulated clusters with those of the observed Galactic globular clusters (GGCs). We find that simply including stellar evolution in our simulations and assuming the typical initial cluster half-mass radius is approximately a few pc independent of mass, our simulated cluster properties agree well with the observed GGC properties such as the core radius and the ratio of the core radius to the half-mass radius. We explore in some detail qualitatively different clusters in different phases of their evolution and construct synthetic Hertzsprung–Russell diagrams for these clusters.},

  abstract = {Stellar clusters are born embedded within giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and during their formation and early evolution are often only visible at infrared wavelengths, being heavily obscured by dust. Over the last 15 years advances in infrared detection capabilities have enabled the first systematic studies of embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In this article we review the current state of empirical knowledge concerning these extremely young protocluster systems. From a survey of the literature we compile the first extensive catalog of galactic embedded cluster properties. We use the catalog to construct the mass function and estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters within roughly 2 Kpc of the Sun. We find that the embedded cluster birthrate exceeds that of visible open clusters by an order of magnitude or more indicating a high infant mortality rate for protocluster systems. Less than 4-7\% of embedded clusters survive emergence from molecular clouds to become bound clusters of Pleiades age. The vast majority (90\%) of stars that form in embedded clusters form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with masses in excess of 50 solar masses. We review the role of embedded clusters in investigating the nature of the IMF which, in one nearby example, has been measured over the entire range of stellar and substellar mass, from OB stars to subsellar objects near the deuterium burning limit. We also review the role embedded clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk evolution and the important constraints they provide for understanding the origin of planetary systems. Finally, we discuss current ideas concerning the origin and dynamical evolution of embedded clusters and the implications for the formation of bound open clusters.},

Starting from a central number density of n = 10\^4 cm\^-3, cloud evolution for 48 models is calculated until the protostar is formed (n \textbackslash simeq 10\^23 cm\^-3) or fragmentation occurs. The fragmentation condition depends both on the initial rotational energy and cloud metallicity. Cloud rotation promotes fragmentation, while fragmentation tends to be suppressed in clouds with higher metallicity. Fragmentation occurs when \textbackslash beta\_0 {$>$} 10\^-3 in clouds with solar metallicity, while fragmentation occurs when \textbackslash beta\_0 {$>$} 10\^-5 in the primordial gas cloud. Clouds with lower metallicity have larger probability of fragmentation, which indicates that the binary frequency is a decreasing function of cloud metallicity. Thus, the binary frequency at the early universe (or lower metallicity environment) is higher than at present day (or higher metallicity environment). In addition, binary stars born from low-metallicity clouds have shorter orbital periods than those from high-metallicity clouds. These trends are explained in terms of the thermal history of the collapsing cloud.},

In a collapsing cloud, fragmentation is mainly controlled by the initial ratio of the rotational to the magnetic energy, regardless of the initial thermal energy and amplitude of the non-axisymmetric perturbation. When the clouds have large rotational energies in relation to magnetic energies, fragmentation occurs in the low-density evolution phase (10\^12 cm\^-3 {$<$} n {$<$} 10\^15 cm\^-3) with separations of 3-300 AU. Fragments that appeared in this phase are expected to evolve into wide binary systems. On the other hand, fragmentation does not occur in the low-density evolution phase, when initial clouds have large magnetic energies in relation to the rotational energies. In these clouds, fragmentation only occurs in the high-density evolution phase (n {$>$} 10\^17 cm\^-3) after the clouds experience significant reduction of the magnetic field owing to Ohmic dissipation in the period of 10\^12 cm\^-3 {$<$} n {$<$} 10\^15 cm\^-3. Fragments appearing in this phase have separations of {$<$} 0.3 AU, and are expected to evolve into close binary systems. As a result, we found two typical fragmentation epochs, which cause different stellar separations. Although these typical separations are disturbed in the subsequent gas accretion phase, we might be able to observe two peaks of binary separations in extremely young stellar groups.},

Mergings of compact-star binaries are expected to be the most important sources for forthcoming gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy. In the first part of the review, we discuss observational manifestations of close binaries with NS and/or BH components and their merger rate, crucial points in the formation and evolution of compact stars in binary systems, including the treatment of the natal kicks, which NSs and BHs acquire during the core collapse of massive stars and the common envelope phase of binary evolution, which are most relevant to the merging rates of NS-NS, NS-BH and BH-BH binaries. The second part of the review is devoted mainly to the formation and evolution of binary WDs and their observational manifestations, including their role as progenitors of cosmologically-important thermonuclear SN Ia. We also consider AM CVn-stars, which are thought to be the best verification binary GW sources for future low-frequency GW space interferometers.},

  abstract = {Eclipsing post-common-envelope binaries are highly important for resolving the poorly understood, very short-lived common-envelope phase of stellar evolution. Most hot subdwarfs (sdO/Bs) are the bare helium-burning cores of red giants that have lost almost all of their hydrogen envelope. This mass loss is often triggered by common-envelope interactions with close stellar or even substellar companions. Cool companions to hot subdwarf stars such as late-type stars and brown dwarfs are detectable from characteristic light-curve variations – reflection effects and often eclipses. In the recently published catalog of eclipsing binaries in the Galactic Bulge and in the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey, we discovered 125 new eclipsing systems showing a reflection effect seen by visual inspection of the light curves and using a machine-learning algorithm, in addition to the 36 systems previously discovered by the Optical Gravitational Lesing Experiment (OGLE) team. The Eclipsing Reflection Effect Binaries from Optical Surveys (EREBOS) project aims at analyzing all newly discovered eclipsing binaries of the HW Vir type (hot subdwarf + close, cool companion) based on a spectroscopic and photometric follow up to derive the mass distribution of the companions, constrain the fraction of substellar companions, and determine the minimum mass needed to strip off the red-giant envelope. To constrain the nature of the primary we derived the absolute magnitude and the reduced proper motion of all our targets with the help of the parallaxes and proper motions measured by the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} mission and compared those to the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} white-dwarf candidate catalog. It was possible to derive the nature of a subset of our targets, for which observed spectra are available, by measuring the atmospheric parameter of the primary, confirming that less than 10\% of our systems are not sdO/Bs with cool companions but are white dwarfs or central stars of planetary nebula. This large sample of eclipsing hot subdwarfs with cool companions allowed us to derive a significant period distribution for hot subdwarfs with cool companions for the first time showing that the period distribution is much broader than previously thought and is ideally suited to finding the lowest-mass companions to hot subdwarf stars. The comparison with related binary populations shows that the period distribution of HW Vir systems is very similar to WD+dM systems and central stars of planetary nebula with cool companions. In the future, several new photometric surveys will be carried out, which will further increase the sample of this project, providing the potential to test many aspects of common-envelope theory and binary evolution.}}},

A chain regularization scheme is used to integrate orbits for 300 or more crossing times in order to guarantee that most systems are fully decayed. In this paper, we consider cases where the number N of point-mass stars is three, four, or five; and we explore effects of the stellar mass spectrum on the outcome in the low angular momentum limit. A novel classification scheme is introduced to identify the remnant decay products, including singles, binaries, and bound hierarchical multiples. The ensemble of final system configurations is then analysed to determine mass and escape speed distributions, and to characterize properties of the binary and triple stars formed during the decay. Some statistical features of the endstates can be understood analytically using well-known principles of few-body dynamics. Our results suggest observable signatures in and around star forming regions which would be expected if multiply fragmenting collapse is a common mode of star formation.},

  abstract = {We explore the consequences of a star formation scenario in which the isothermal collapse of a rotating, star-forming core is followed by prompt fragmentation into a cluster containing a small number () of protostars and/or substellar objects. The subsequent evolution of the cluster is assumed to be dominated by dynamical interactions among cluster members, and this establishes the final properties of the binary and multiple systems. The characteristic scale of the fragmenting core is determined by the cloud initial conditions (such as temperature, angular momentum and mass), and we are able to relate the separation distributions of the final binary population to the properties of the star-forming core. Because the fragmentation scale immediately after the isothermal collapse is typically a factor of 3-10 too large, we conjecture that fragmentation into small clusters followed by dynamical evolution is required to account for the observed binary separation distributions. Differences in the environmental properties of the cores are expected to imprint differences on the characteristic dimensions of the binary systems they form. Recent observations of hierarchical systems, differences in binary characteristics among star forming regions and systematic variations in binary properties with primary mass can be interpreted in the context of this scenario.},

  abstract = {Field stars are frequently formed in pairs, and many of these binaries are part of triples or even higher-order systems. Even though, the principles of single stellar evolution and binary evolution, have been accepted for a long time, the long-term evolution of stellar triples is poorly understood. The presence of a third star in an orbit around a binary system can significantly alter the evolution of those stars and the binary system. The rich dynamical behavior in three-body systems can give rise to Lidov-Kozai cycles, in which the eccentricity of the inner orbit and the inclination between the inner and outer orbit vary periodically. In turn, this can lead to an enhancement of tidal effects (tidal friction), gravitational-wave emission and stellar interactions such as mass transfer and collisions. The lack of a self-consistent treatment of triple evolution, including both three-body dynamics as well as stellar evolution, hinders the systematic study and general understanding of the long-term evolution of triple systems. In this paper, we aim to address some of these hiatus, by discussing the dominant physical processes of hierarchical triple evolution, and presenting heuristic recipes for these processes. To improve our understanding on hierarchical stellar triples, these descriptions are implemented in a public source code TrES which combines three-body dynamics (based on the secular approach) with stellar evolution and their mutual influences. Note that modeling through a phase of stable mass transfer in an eccentric orbit is currently not implemented in TrES , but can be implemented with the appropriate methodology at a later stage.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context. {$<$}i/{$>$}Binary population synthesis (BPS) modelling is a very effective tool to study the evolution and properties of various types of close binary systems. The uncertainty in the parameters of the model and their effect on a population can be tested in a statistical way, which then leads to a deeper understanding of the underlying (sometimes poorly understood) physical processes involved. Several BPS codes exist that have been developed with different philosophies and aims. Although BPS has been very successful for studies of many populations of binary stars, in the particular case of the study of the progenitors of supernovae Type Ia, the predicted rates and ZAMS progenitors vary substantially between different BPS codes.\emph{Aims. {$<$}i/{$>$}To understand the predictive power of BPS codes, we study the similarities and differences in the predictions of four different BPS codes for low- and intermediate-mass binaries. We investigate the differences in the characteristics of the predicted populations, and whether they are caused by different assumptions made in the BPS codes or by numerical effects, e.g. a lack of accuracy in BPS codes.\emph{Methods. {$<$}i/{$>$}We compare a large number of evolutionary sequences for binary stars, starting with the same initial conditions following the evolution until the first (and when applicable, the second) white dwarf (WD) is formed. To simplify the complex problem of comparing BPS codes that are based on many (often different) assumptions, we equalise the assumptions as much as possible to examine the inherent differences of the four BPS codes. \emph{Results. {$<$}i/{$>$}We find that the simulated populations are similar between the codes. Regarding the population of binaries with one WD, there is very good agreement between the physical characteristics, the evolutionary channels that lead to the birth of these systems, and their birthrates. Regarding the double WD population, there is a good agreement on which evolutionary channels exist to create double WDs and a rough agreement on the characteristics of the double WD population. Regarding which progenitor systems lead to a single and double WD system and which systems do not, the four codes agree well. Most importantly, we find that for these two populations, the differences in the predictions from the four codes are not due to numerical differences, but because of different inherent assumptions. We identify critical assumptions for BPS studies that need to be studied in more detail.}}}}},
